Caesar Cipher in the command-line made in Python.

Originally made for my school's computer science class homework assignment, but expanded upon to include extra features for fun.

## Features
- Classic Caesar Cipher encryption gameplay
- Customisable encryption key
- Works for both capital and lowercase letters and numbers (alphanumeric)
- Cycles back if out of bounds (e.g.: Z + 1 -> A ; 9 + 1 -> 0)
- Decryption supported by inputting the negative of encryption keys
